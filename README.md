Sometimes it will be about system calls or programs very different from other

  Char Check:
  
The char check program is a simple program where the simple number pyramid program is pushed to extent of its efficiency and less memory storage where the numbers are decalred as char for higher efficiency and used sys calls for time efficiency though library calls does buffering it needs to call libc and then process the data.This source code is compiled by gcc with -no-startfiles and -s flags by compiling like this no debug information is stored and program execution starts in start function other than main function for increasing more time efficiency.
